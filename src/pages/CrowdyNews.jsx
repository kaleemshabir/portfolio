      <h2>Social Media Content Curation and Widget Platform</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
        <p>
          As the Vue.js Developer and Website Designer on this project, I played
          a pivotal role in the transformation of an existing PHP application
          into a dynamic Vue.js-powered platform that revolutionizes content
          curation and web traffic optimization for users and brands. My
          contributions not only demonstrate my expertise in front-end
          development but also highlight my ability to enhance user experiences
          and optimize website performance.

        <h2>Key Features:</h2>
        <p>
          1.<strong>Multi-Platform Data Collection:</strong> Our platform
          seamlessly combines content from various social media sources,
          including Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter. Users can choose
          to curate content manually or leverage the power of our AI-driven
          platform to automatically select content. Real-time updates and
          sorting by popularity keep users informed and engaged.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Filter & Control:</strong> Our intelligent filtering system,
          combined with manual moderation options, empowers users to maintain
          full control over what content gets published on their websites.
          Safeguarding their online reputation is our ultimate goal, ensuring
          that only relevant and appropriate content is displayed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Usage Statistics: I implemented a bar graph to visually represent the
          usage of content from different social media platforms. This feature
          allows users to track and understand how much of their allotted
          content quota, such as Twitter's 250 users limit, is being utilized.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Widget Views Analytics: </strong> To provide valuable
          insights, I designed a second bar graph that displays the total widget
          views for each day within a week. This graph illustrates the weekly
          trends in widget views, enabling users to make data-driven decisions
          to optimize their content strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Publish & Profit:</strong> The platform offers an effortless
          and user-friendly experience. With just a few lines of code, users can
          set up widgets on their websites. This simplicity ensures quick
          implementation, allowing users to start driving engagement and
          increasing conversions immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.<strong>Topic-Based Filtering: </strong> Users have the power to
          create custom topics by selecting their preferred platforms and
          applying specific filtering parameters, ensuring that they receive the
          most relevant and valuable content.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.<strong>Widget Conversion Module:</strong> One of the standout
          features of this platform is the ability to transform curated topics
          into widgets that users can easily integrate into their own websites.
          This functionality not only provides value but also drives significant
          traffic to their sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.<strong>Brand Integration:</strong> Brands are also welcome to
          leverage our platform by showcasing their website data as widgets.
          This unique offering results in a substantial boost in website traffic
          and, ultimately, sales for our brand partners.
